# Codebase for Benchmarking Bias Mitigation Algorithms in Representation Learning through Fairness Metrics.

This repository is the official implementation of [Benchmarking Bias Mitigation Algorithms in Representation Learning through Fairness Metrics][benchmarking]

As increasingly more attention and importance is given to algorithmic fairness by machine learning researchers and practitioners, with new models being proposed to make predictions more 'fair', there
is a void of a common framework to analyze and compare their capabilities. In this work, we evaluate different fairness methods trained with deep neural networks on a common synthetic dataset and a real-world dataset to aid and obtain insight into the behaviour of methods that seek to improve the fairness of predictions by deep learning models. Overall, we present a dataset, propose various biased evaluation setups, and rigorously evaluate recently proposed debiasing algorithms in a common framework.

## Quickstart

A code snippet that demonstrastes how to quickly benchmark a particlar technique on our synthetic dataset:
```
python train/execute.py --arch "mlp/conv/laftr-dp/laftr-eqodd/laftr-eqopp0/laftr-eqopp1/ffvae/cfair/cfair-eo" --ifwandb
```

## What are the datasets and associated tasks?

* CI-MNIST dataset: A variant of [MNIST][mnist], where we introduce different types of correlations between dataset features and eligibility criterion.
* Adult dataset: Original [Adult][adult] dataset with a new sensitive dataset feature correlated with eligibility criterion.

## Which models have been implemented and tested?

* [LAFTR][laftr][5] - Laftr-DP, Laftr-EqOpp0, Laftr-EqOpp1, Laftr-EqOdd variants
* [CFAIR][cfair][6] - Cfair, Cfair-EO variants
* [FFVAE][ffvae][7]
* MLP
* CNN

## How do we measure fairness?
We calculate several fairness metrics that are established in the fairness literature and have all been listed [here][metrics], but due to time and space constraints we restrict ourselves to the ones listed below. Note that there is neither a universal fairness metric nor a universally accepted definition of fairness.

## Setup
```bash
python3 -m venv fair_benchmark
source fair_benchmark/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
export PYTHONPATH=`pwd`$PYTHONPATH
```

## Reproducing paper experiments

Make sure that the adult and mnist datasets are in the ./data/ folder

For CI-MNIST dataset:
```bash
python dataloaders/mnist_loader.py --data_dir ./data
```

For Adult dataset:
Upload data files from the [Adult website][adult] to ./data/ folder

Once downloaded you can run CI-MNIST experiments like:
```bash
python scripts/coloredmnist/setting12/cfair_multiple_launcher.py
```

Once installed you can run ADULT experiments like:
```bash
python scripts/adult/setting12/cfair_multiple_launcher.py
```

As well as all the other scripts under scripts/adult or scripts/coloredmnist in order to complete the sweep of experiments that were completed for the results in the paper

For reproducing results in Setting 1, 2 of CI-MNIST:
```
Run the files in scripts/coloredmnist/setting12/ folder.
```

For reproducing results in Setting 3, 4 of CI-MNIST:
```
Run the files in scripts/coloredmnist/setting34/ folder. 
```

For reproducing results in Setting 1, 2 of Adult:
```
Run the files in scripts/adult/setting12/ folder.
```

For reproducing ablation experiments in Tables 54 to 59 in the paper:
```
Run the files in scripts/ablations folder.
```

NOTE: Please remember to change the output directory argument (odir) from /scratch/charanr/fairness-project/

### Generating plots and tables
Initially generate the csvs of the experiments ran from wandb

Then parse the csvs, adds processed csvs to processed_csvs/ folder
```
python plots_tables/csvs/parse_csv.py
```

To create plots in paper, run files in plots_tables, example
```
python plots_tables/plots/barplots_adult.py
python plots_tables/plots/barplots_mnist.py
python plots_tables/plots/heatmap_std_adult.py
python plots_tables/plots/heatmap_std_mnist.py
python plots_tables/plots/heatmap_corr.py
```

To generate tables in the paper, run
```
python plots_tables/tables/get_tables.py
```
